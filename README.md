# NLU-assignment-1
Natural Language Understanding assignment 1 about tasks to understand Recurrent Neural Networks. An analysis report was written based on the questions from the description file.

# What is the coursework mainly about?
1. Implementation of a few critical parts of a recurrent neural network and the back-propagation algorithm.
2. Experiment in training to adapt the model to a task about predicting number agreement between subject and predicate in English.

# What I learned in this coursework?
1. Implementation of RNNs and backpropagation.
2. Parameter tuning in training language models.
3. Analyzed effects and chose from a set of parameters.
